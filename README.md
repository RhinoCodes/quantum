# Quantum
## A Package Manager that doesn't screw with your system

Quantum is primarily a non-root pkg manager that installs things to a users home directory.<br>This feature was originally created so that computers running SEMCOS wouldnt have death by package manager, but then we split off into a seperate project. 

To install clone and run
`./setup_env` and add `export PATH=~/quantum/bin/:$PATH` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
